# 🎯 Student Contributions Hub

Welcome to the **Student Contributions Hub**!
This repository is a collaborative space for all participants of the GitHub Workshop. Each student will contribute their own folder containing something useful — it could be a mini project, resources, notes, or anything worth sharing.

By the end, this repo will become a **shared knowledge base + portfolio of our batch**, while giving everyone hands-on experience with GitHub collaboration. 🚀

## 📌 How to Contribute

Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the forked repo to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/student-contributions.git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** with your name:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-yourname
   ```
4. Inside the `/students/` folder, **create a new folder with your name**.
   Example:

   ```
   /students/rahul/
   ```
5. Add at least one contribution inside your folder. You can choose from:

   * 📂 A small project / script
   * 🌐 A list of useful website links (with short descriptions in Markdown)
   * 📝 Notes or a cheatsheet you prepared
   * 💡 Any other useful resource or writeup
6. **Stage, commit, and push** your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added Rahul's folder with resources"
   git push origin add-rahul
   ```
7. Go to the original repo and **open a Pull Request**.

## ✅ Contribution Rules

* Each student **must create their own folder** inside `/students/`.
* Keep your contributions **organized and meaningful**.
* Write proper commit messages (not just “update” or “stuff”).
* Do **not** edit or delete other students’ folders/files.
* If you’re adding links, always include a **short description** (why it’s useful).

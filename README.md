# 🎯 Student Contributions Hub

Welcome to the **Student Contributions Hub**!
This repository is a collaborative space for all participants of the GitHub Workshop. Each student will contribute their **own folder in the root of this repo**, containing something useful — it could be a mini project, resources, notes, or anything worth sharing.

By the end, this repo will become a **shared knowledge base + portfolio of our batch**, while giving everyone hands-on experience with GitHub collaboration. 🚀

* If you’re adding links, always include a **short description** (why it’s useful).
